# Signup UI

## Overview

Signup UI has provision to verify the user's phone number with OTP and on successful verification user is allowed to 
register in the integrated ID registry. Both register and reset password requires OTP verification.

The registration form is built using MOSIP's [Dynamic form library](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-sdk/tree/develop/json-form-builder).

## Dynamic Registration Form

This is a flexible, plug-and-play library that generates forms with automated validation. It takes an identity schema as input and dynamically builds a registration form to match it.

For more details on how to use the library, please refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-sdk/blob/develop/json-form-builder/README.md).

For Identity schema reference, see this [MOSIP UI JSON specification](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/id-lifecycle-management/identity-issuance/registration-client/develop/registration-client-ui-specifications#field-spec-json-template).

> **Note:** Only the **Field spec JSON template** section from the above link is applicable here.

### How to used Dynamic form library

#### 1. Get Identity schema from the /registration/ui-spec endpoint of signup-service

#### 2. Pass that schema into the library, with some of custom values as per your needs
Here **uiSchema** contains the identity schema and some other placeholder
```ts
const form = JsonFormBuilder(
    {
        schema: uiSchema.schema,
        language: uiSchema.language,
        allowedValues: uiSchema.allowedValues,
        errors: uiSchema.errors,
    },
    "form-container",
    {
        submitButton: {
            label: 'Submit',
            action: <CALLBACK_METHOD>,
        },
        language: {
            currentLanguage: <CURRENT_LANGUAGE>,
            defaultLanguage: <DEFAULT_LANGUAGE>,
        },
        recaptcha: {
            siteKey: <YOUR_SITE_KEY>,
            enabled: true,
            langugae: 'en'
        }
    }
);
```

#### 3. There is an option to add reCaptcha as well, so you can pass reCaptcha site key with the parameter 


## Local Development

### First Setup

To install relevant npm packages, run the following script:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running Locally

#### Browser

During development, it is recommended to use Chrome, and it needed to be open with --disable-web-security mode to avoid CORS errors.

Mac users use the following command:

```bash
open -na Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir=/tmp/temporary-chrome-profile-dir --disable-web-security
```

Ubuntu users use the following command:

```bash
google-chrome-stable --user-data-dir="~/ dev session" --disable-web-security
```

#### Scripts

##### Web app

To start the web application, run the following script:

```bash
npm start
```

This opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

##### Storybook

To start the storybook, run the following script:

```bash
npm storybook
```

This opens [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) in the browser. Making change to the components in the project triggers hot reload in storybook.

##### Testing

To run all test cases, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

#### Environments

`.env.example` file is provided in the root folder. In the development, copy and paste the variables described into a self-created `.env.local` file, replacing the required values accordingly.

By default, the environment variables are:
| variable | value |
| -------- | ----- |
| `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` | http://localhost:8088/v1/signup |

#### Translation

New translations can be added in the `locales` folder of the `public` folder. Also, newly added key(s) need to be added to `resource.d.ts` to fulfill the type and get the key suggestion.
